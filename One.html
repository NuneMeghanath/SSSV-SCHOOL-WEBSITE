				Sri Sai Saraswathi Vidyaniketan School is a remarkable institution where students from diverse backgrounds can develop academically, become involved, and have a meaningful school experience.
				 I am convinced that an educational institution is not just about bricks, mortar, and concrete, but also about character development, mind enrichment, and life-challenging experiences.<br><br>
				 Believes more in  “Experiential Learning” rather than as a set of instructions only from textbooks.

				<img src="https://saisaraswathi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MS.-Usha-Meenakshi-1.png"><br>
				
				Education is a powerful tool for social change. The successful running of the school depends on the head of the institution as the adage goes “As is the king so are the subjects “.
				 I am privileged to be a part of the institution and its my duty and responsibility to scale the high-level functions of the school. I believe in “Leaders making leaders” for every individual is instilled in leadership qualities. Along with the teachers, the innate talents of students are tapped to the full.
				 Education is  holistic and just not mark-oriented academics.We believe in teamwork with the best efforts for the learning outcome of the children, as today’s children are our future.<br><br>
